  "description": "I want to update the documentation and consildate @README.md with the chat service @README.md and get rid of the chat service readme. We should also remove the @services/chat/LICENSE file. Also should consolidate all the .gitignore files into the root .gitignore file. Then go through the project and make sure the .gitignore file and ensure that it meets all the normal ignores for the all the langages and things in this project"
