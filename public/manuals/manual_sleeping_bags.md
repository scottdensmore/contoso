# Sleeping Bag User Guide

## Usage
- Use a sleeping pad for insulation and comfort.
- Wear clean, dry clothing to sleep.
- Use the hood drawstrings to retain heat on cold nights.

## Storage
- **Do Not Compress:** Store the bag loose in a large mesh sack or hung up. Long-term compression damages the insulation.
- Only use the compression sack for travel.

## Cleaning
- Spot clean dirty areas with a damp sponge.
- Wash only when necessary in a large front-loading commercial washer with specialized down or synthetic soap.
