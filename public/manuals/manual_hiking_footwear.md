# Hiking Footwear Care Guide

## Breaking In
- Wear your new boots indoors or on short walks before attempting a long hike to prevent blisters.

## Cleaning
- Remove dirt and mud after every hike using a soft brush and water.
- Remove insoles and laces for a thorough clean.

## Drying
- Dry slowly at room temperature.
- **Avoid Heat:** Never place boots near a fire, heater, or radiator, as this can damage the leather and adhesives.

## Maintenance
- Treat leather boots with a conditioner to prevent cracking.
- Re-apply waterproofing treatments as needed.
