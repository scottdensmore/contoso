# Backpack User Guide

## Fitting Your Backpack
1. Loosen all straps before putting the pack on.
2. Position the hip belt so it sits on your hip bones, not your waist.
3. Tighten the shoulder straps to bring the pack close to your back.
4. Adjust the load lifters (straps on top of shoulders) to take weight off your shoulders.
5. Fasten the sternum strap for stability.
