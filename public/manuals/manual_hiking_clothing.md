# Hiking Clothing Care Guide

## Washing Instructions
- **Read the Label:** Always follow the specific care label on your garment.
- **Detergent:** Use a mild, technical detergent designed for outdoor gear. Avoid fabric softeners.
- **Temperature:** Wash in cold or warm water to preserve technical fabrics.

## Drying
- **Air Dry:** Line dry whenever possible to save energy and extend garment life.
- **Tumble Dry:** If necessary, use low heat.

## Re-waterproofing
- For waterproof items (DWR), re-apply a water-repellent spray or wash-in treatment once water stops beading on the surface.
